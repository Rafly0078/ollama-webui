/**
 * Context compaction — keep long conversations within the model's window by
 * condensing older turns into a running summary instead of sending the full
 * transcript every request.
 *
 * The flow (driven from use-chat):
 *  1. estimate the token cost of what would be sent this turn;
 *  2. if it crosses `COMPACT_RATIO` of the conversation's context length,
 *     keep the most recent messages verbatim up to a token reserve and ask the
 *     model to summarize everything older (folding any previous summary in so
 *     nothing is lost);
 *  3. store the new summary + the id of the last message it covers.
 *
 * Recent messages are held by token budget, not a fixed count, so a single
 * code paste larger than the reserve can't force several huge messages to stay
 * and overflow the window. When even that isn't enough (a lone message bigger
 * than num_ctx), `stillOverBudget` lets the caller warn the user.
 *
 * toApiMessages then injects that summary and drops the covered messages, so
 * the model keeps the memory at a fraction of the token cost.
